# Simple Web UTC Clock

## Introductions
Here I share a simple web app that I created, a UTC clock.But the 
focus of this repository is how to build and deploy it.

### Application description
This app shows the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) using python, flask and dockers.

**This is the flask structure:**
```
/simple-web-UTC-clock
    clock.py
    /templates
        index.html
    /static
        script.js
        styles.css
```
